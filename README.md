► Install this asset into your project
► Start saving your data... The end!

It really is THAT easy...

# FEATURES

► Save anything that you can turn into a string to your WordPress database and fetch it back again (including base64 encoded binary data)

► Returned data can be extracted as:

int, long, float, Rect, Color, Vector2,  Vector3, bool, string and more...

► Saves data to your server categorized for easy bulk retrieval. You can literally fetch all your player's data using a single line of code...

Data is stored to a users account meaning they get the current data no matter what device or platform they are playing on. They can even play at an internet cafe or a borrowed device. Their data follows them no matter where they play, what they play on or who's device they play on...

# TECHNICAL DETAILS

► Save a player's data for the current game (High score, progress, etc.)
► Save a player's data to be shared across games (custom avatar settings, login tokens, etc.)
► Save game info shared by all players (Tweak the game's difficulties/prices/etc and have the changes live immediately. No need for players to re-download the binary to receive your updates)
► Save images to user specific folders
► Update other player's data (In authoritative games, prevent each user from saving their own match results)
